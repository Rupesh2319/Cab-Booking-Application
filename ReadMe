Developed a full-stack cab booking application using React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Spring Boot for the backend, with MySQL as the database management system.
Implemented CRUD functionalities allowing users to sign up/login, select starting and ending points, and choose from multiple cab types (auto, prime, sedan).
Established communication between frontend and backend through RESTful APIs to handle booking requests and data management.
